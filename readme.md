Antiferromagnetic resonace spectrometer software

 Program controls high field (up to 10T) electron spin resonance spectrometer. Process of measurements is: 
 - charge capacitors, 
 - than discharge they on copper solenoid and the same moment to start high frequency ADC (up to 10 MHz, 14 bit)
 - read data from ADC from field and signal channels and construct spectrum using model describing link 
   between ADC data and magnetic field
